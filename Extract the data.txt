2) Extract the data from data base using python



description:
Connect to the SQLite database using the connect() function and create a cursor object to 
interact with the database. We then execute a query using the execute() method and fetch all the 
rows using the fetchall() method. Finally, we loop through the fetched rows and print them. 
Don't forget to close the database connection using the close() method after you're done with it. 
Note that you need to replace 'example.db' with the actual name of your database file, and 
'my_table' with the actual name of the table from which you want to fetch data. Also, you may 
need to modify the query according to your specific requirements. Other database libraries such 
as MySQLdb, psycopg2, or pymongo may have slightly different syntax and usage, so you 
would need to refer to their respective documentation.

implementation:

import sqlite3 
 
# Connect to the database 
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') 
cursor = conn.cursor() 
 
# Execute a query to retrieve data 
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM example_table') 
rows = cursor.fetchall()  # Fetch all rows returned by the query 
 
# Process the retrieved data 
for row in rows: 
    print(row)  # You can access the columns in the row using row[0], row[1], etc. 
 
# Close the database connection 
conn.close()

output:
(1,'Alice',30)
(2,'Bob',25)
